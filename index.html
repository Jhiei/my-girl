                    It's our second Valentines together. We fought this
                    pandemic so well right? Despite how harsh it's effects are,
                    we have become stronger and stronger than we can ever be.
                    I want to say thank you because you stuck with me even though
                    I always make you cry. I'm sorry I don't mean to! You mean much
                    more than the world to me and trust me I will always be here for you.
                    I just want to let you know that I love you and always will
                    despite all odds. I will never ever let anything break us apart
                    and always pray for the strength and love that comes from God to
                    bind us together. I know you dream a lot of me leaving you but baby,
                    never believe them okay? I assure you that I will never leave your side.
                    We have been through so much together and I want to tell you that throughout
                    the rollercoaster ride, from the moment I confessed my love to you until now,
                    my love always became stronger. I'll never let you go anywhere else except 
                    beside me my love. I'm just here.
                    <br><br>
                    Envisioning the future, I can't imagine it without you. All I can see is a
                    loving partner who will support me to the fullest and be grumpy all the time.
                    Yes, that's you. I can imagine myself taking care of you while you're carrying 
                    our cute child, I'm sure he or she is going to inherit all the cuteness from me.
                    I'm so excited for what God has in store for us. Even if it's something heavy that
                    we will have to go through, I'm happy because I know and I trust in the Lord that
                    He will uphold us both to make us even more stronger than we have ever been.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you baby for being there, really. I am so grateful that you came into my life
                    and stuck with me throughout this whole time, all the good and the bad times. I can't 
                    describe in words how much I love you. We've fought but we just become stronger, let's 
                    keep this up okay? More years and months to come for us baby, I'll see you again for 
                    our next Valentine's okay? I love you so much baby, mahal na mahal na mahal kita ng sobra
                    sobra. So I want to ask you this question... scroll down.
